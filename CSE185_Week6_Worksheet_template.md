# CSE 185 Lab 6 Worksheet

## Part 1: Mass spectrometry

**What level is the first scan?** (1pt)
msLevel=2

**How many peaks are in the first scan?** (1 pt)
205

**How many scans are in the entire file?** (1 pt)
21409

**In the first spectrum that loaded (spectrum ID 4970), what is the m/z ratio of the most intense peak? (You can see this by hovering your mouse over that peak).** (1pt)
555.056

**In the summary tab, compute the summary charts. Then: what are the two most abundant precursor ion charges?** (1pt)
2,3

**How many spectra are in our filtered file?** (1pt)
1,001

**The top hit is a contaminant! What is it? Give one sentence explanation of why this shows up in our list.** (1 pt)
Trypsin. This enzyme is used during the mass spec process to fragment proteins (trypsinization)

**List the top 5 scoring protein hits (not contaminants!)** (1 pt)
NUCL, DHX9, TR150, EF1A1, PRP8

**How many peptides were found to match the top hit, NUCL_MOUSE (Nucleolin)?** (1pt)
7

**Briefly investigate the function of the top 3 genes. Are any known to be related to telomere function?** (3pts)
Nucleolin - http://www.jbc.org/content/279/49/51508.full
DHX9 - https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24990949
TR150 - https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4889927/
